README: Python Integration with ChatGPT/OpenAI API and Google Docs

Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate Python with the OpenAI API (ChatGPT) to build an application that learns from data stored in a Google Docs folder. The application reads documents from a specified Google Docs folder, processes the content, and utilizes OpenAI's capabilities to analyze, summarize, or generate insights based on the data.

Features

Google Docs Integration

Accesses and reads all documents from a specified Google Docs folder using the Google Drive API.

Retrieves document content for further processing.

OpenAI API Integration

Connects to OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for natural language understanding and generation.

Performs tasks like summarization, content analysis, question answering, or custom workflows based on the document data.

Data Pipeline

Automates the workflow of fetching data from Google Docs, processing it, and sending relevant content to OpenAI.

Outputs results in a structured format for further use.

Prerequisites

Tools and Libraries
